For 2 guests staying 2 nights, and total price `800 z≈Ç`, you will see:

Price per guest: 400.00 z≈Ç
Price per guest per night: 200.00 z≈Ç

If the price is in another currency like ‚Ç¨, it will automatically show:

Price per guest: 300.00 ‚Ç¨

- Currency is auto-detected from the price text.
- If Booking.com dynamically updates listings (e.g. via filters), you must click the extension icon to reapply calculations.
